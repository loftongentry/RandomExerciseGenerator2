# RandomExerciseGenerator2
This is a program intended to be used as both practice for me in developing new programming skills, as well as to enable me to randomly output exercises to do when I am
not running. This is the second iteration of this program, as the first became corrupted.

**The program works as follows:**
1. User specifies if they want to add an exercise to an already established exercise data set (~~data set not implemented yet~~)(test data set implemented)
   - 1.1. User can add as many exercises as they desire until they specify they no longer want to add any (User adds these to the test data set for now)
2. User specifies the number of exercises they want to perform, as well as
   - a. The location to perform the exercise
   - b. If the exercise is weighted or not
   - c. The muscle location targeted while performing the exercise
3. Program will then randomly output user specified amount of exercises that fit those three parameters

**Future Ideas/Goals:** 
- [ ] 1. Allow user to create and save new exercise sets
   - [ ] 1.1 Can be used for randomly accessing exercises specifically from those sets
   - [ ] 1.2 Can be used to randomize order in which user performs exercises
- [ ] 2. Adding other parameters such as number of reps and/or time (subclass constructor?)
- [ ] 3. Implement GUI so program does not run through terminal (JavaFX possibly)
- [ ] ~~4. Much further down the line, create an application that can be run on your phone (Java for Android, Swift for iOS)~~ (Don't want the project to increase in scope too dramatically)
